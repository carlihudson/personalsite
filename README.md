# personalsite

## Description

I thought of this idea early into my interest in making a career change into software development. Having a personal website is a huge part of being a software developer, so why not start now? It will be a great tool to look back on, and continuously edit, as my knowledge and expertise grows, and a nice visual for friends, family, colleagues, and even potentially employers to look back on.
