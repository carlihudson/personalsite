        <p>My name is Carli Hudson, and I am a student at UCLA Extentsion's Software Development Bootcamp. I've held a lot of random jobs throughout my 15 years in the workforce (am I showing my age?) such as:</p>
       <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Fast Food Worker</li>
            <li>Amusement Park Portrait Artist</li>
            <li>Student Libraian</li>
            <li>Video Intern</li>
            <li>Hardware Store Worker</li>
            <li>Taste Tester</li>
            <li>Face Painter</li>
            <li>TV/Movie Set Production Assistant</li>
            <li>Paint Teacher</li>
            <li>Food Delivery Driver</li>
            <li>Country Club Beverage Cart Girl</li>
            <li>Talent Agency Assistant (Executive and Personal)</li>
            <li>Current Job: Studio Data Administrator</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>After a chaotic 15 years working whatever I could find to survive, I decided it was time to make a change for the good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am going to continue to update this site as I learn more in my Bootcamp. As you can see, I have only very basic knowlege right now, as this site looks like it was made in 1995.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I hope you'll follow along with me, and I can't wait to see what this journey brings me!</p>
