      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>My name is Carli Hudson, and I am a student at UCLA Extentsion's Software Development Bootcamp. I've held a lot
        of random jobs throughout my 15 years in the workforce such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast Food Worker</li>
        <li>Amusement Park Portrait Artist</li>
        <li>Student Libraian</li>
        <li>Video Intern</li>
        <li>Hardware Store Worker</li>
        <li>Taste Tester</li>
        <li>Face Painter</li>
        <li>TV/Movie Set Production Assistant</li>
        <li>Paint Teacher</li>
        <li>Food Delivery Driver</li>
        <li>Country Club Beverage Cart Girl</li>
        <li>Talent Agency Assistant (Executive and Personal)</li>
        <li>Current Job: Studio Data Administrator</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After a chaotic 15 years working whatever I could find to survive, I decided it was time to make a change for
        the good.</p>
      <p>I am going to continue to update this site as I learn more in my Bootcamp. As you can see, I have only very
        basic knowlege right now, as this site looks like it was made in 2001.</p>
      <p>I hope you'll follow along with me, and I can't wait to see what this journey brings me!</p>
